### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California: Irvine](https://uci.edu), in the [Intelligent Dynamics Lab](https://indylab.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Roy Fox](https://royf.org). Previously, I worked as a visiting researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and I obtained my PhD at the University of Verona advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/).

### Research Interests ðŸ”­
My research interests focus on developing novel **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** methods applied to robotics, with a particular emphasis on the generation of reliable systems in safety-critical contexts. As an essential aspect of my work, I constantly try to merge theoretical research with practical application to real-world robotic problems.
