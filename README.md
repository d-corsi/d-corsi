### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California: Irvine](https://uci.edu), working in the [Intelligent Dynamics Lab](https://indylab.org) led by [Prof. Roy Fox](https://royf.org). Before that, I spent time as a visiting researcher with [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and completed my PhD at the University of Verona under [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/).

### Research Interests ðŸ”­  
Iâ€™m passionate about advancing **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** for robotics, with a strong focus on making it **safe and reliable** in real-world, safety-critical environments. My research explores:  

- **Safety in RL**: constrained RL, formal **verification**, and **shielding** to ensure robots behave safely when deployed.
  **Foundation models for robotics**: as part of the [DARPA SAFRON project](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/safron), I am investigating how **LLMs, VLMs, and VLAMs** can be integrated into robotic control, with a special emphasis on **safety** â€” moving beyond treating these models as black boxes.  
- **Generative & causal world models**: building generative models that enable robots to **predict the future** and **reason about consequences**, while structuring these models with **causal inference** to improve their **generalization** across tasks and environments.  

âš¡ Bridging the gap between theory and practical robotics is at the heart of what I do âš¡
