### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California: Irvine](https://uci.edu), working in the [Intelligent Dynamics Lab](https://indylab.org) led by [Prof. Roy Fox](https://royf.org). Before that, I spent time as a visiting researcher with [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and completed my PhD at the University of Verona under [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/).

### Research Interests ðŸ”­  
I'm passionate about advancing **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** for robotics, especially making it **safe and reliable** in real-world, safety-critical environments. My work focuses on **constrained reinforcement learning**, **verification**, and **shielding** methods to ensure that robots behave safely when deployed.  
Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into **generative models** to build **world models** â€” equipping robots with the ability to **predict the future** and **make informed decisions** based on the consequences of their actions. I'm also applying **causal reasoning** to structure these models better and boost their generalization to new scenarios.  
Bridging the gap between theory and practical robotics is at the heart of what I do.
